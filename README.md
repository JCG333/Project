# Vision

The vision of this project is to develop a functional and user-friendly website and a database where information about wind turbines is retrieved and displayed. The project requires that each turbine has location information, as well as both current status with images and historical data linked to it stored in the database.
A database needs to be set up. Additionally, an API from SMHI must be implemented to gather weather data. The website needs to be built with a login page, a filtering and search page for the user's wind turbines, pages where the selected turbine's status is displayed with images and weather data from SMHI. History should be available for the different turbines with older weather data from SMHI.
